### 1. Technical Breakdown (The Mechanics)

The "AppSec Roundup" of June 2025 marked a definitive shift from static, point-in-time vulnerability assessments to **Continuous Threat Modeling (CTM)** and **Runtime Reachability Analysis**. The technical mechanics observed during this period represent a maturation of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) into a more resilient, AI-augmented framework.

#### A. Automated Threat Modeling (ATM) and Graph-Based Analysis
By mid-2025, the industry transitioned from manual Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) to automated, graph-based threat modeling. These systems utilize **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to ingest infrastructure-as-code (IaC) templates, OpenAPI specifications, and cloud configuration metadata. The mechanics involve mapping nodes (microservices, databases, S3 buckets) and edges
