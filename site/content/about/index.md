## About Me

Terbaik! (That's "best" in Malay, and I do mean it with every fibre of my being when it comes to cybersecurity.) Based in the bustling NYC, I bring a global perspective to cybersecurity strategy, having lived and worked across Malaysia 🇲🇾, Hong Kong, and various regions spanning APAC, EMEA, UK, and the US.

I'm a cybersecurity specialist who genuinely enjoys connecting the dots between technical intricacies and business objectives. Whether it's architecting cloud security initiatives in financial services or crafting robust defense strategies for enterprises across telco, transportation, logistics, and beyond, I've always believed that ***great security doesn't exist in a vacuum***—it's gotta make business sense, lah!

My sweet spot? Taking complex security challenges and breaking them down into actionable, pragmatic solutions that your boardroom and your security teams actually understand and can execute on.

### What I Do

My expertise spans the full spectrum of modern cybersecurity:

- **Cloud Security & Infrastructure**: Designing and implementing cloud security architectures that scale across business lines and regions
- **Threat Intelligence & Risk Management**: Identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks using both traditional methods and cutting-edge intelligence
- **Vulnerability & Compliance**: Conducting comprehensive vulnerability assessments while ensuring regulatory alignment (think GDPR, SOC 2, industry-specific frameworks)
- **Machine Learning for Security**: Leveraging ML and data analytics to detect anomalies, predict threats, and automate security operations at scale

### My Focus Areas

I'm particularly energized by:

- **Cyber Risk & Regulatory Intelligence**: Navigating the increasingly complex landscape of cybersecurity regulations and translating compliance requirements into strategic advantage
- **Threat Intelligence & Detection**: Building systems and teams that stay ahead of emerging threats, especially those targeting financial services and critical infrastructure
- **Technology & Innovation**: Exploring how ML, automation, and modern tech stacks can strengthen our collective defense posture
- **Cross-Regional Security Strategy**: Having worked across multiple regions, I understand that one-size-fits-all doesn't work—each market has its own flavor of risk and regulation

### Philosophy

I believe in:

- **Business-First Security**: The best security strategy is one that actually protects the crown jewels without strangling business operations
- **Pragmatic Problem-Solving**: Cut through the noise; focus on what matters. Perfect is the enemy of protected.
- **Human-Centric Approach**: Security lives at the intersection of people, process, and technology. Skip any one, and you've got a problem
- **Continuous Learning**: The threat landscape moves fast. Staying curious and adaptive isn't optional—it's essential
- **Building Effective Teams**: Security is a team sport. I'm passionate about developing teams, sharing knowledge, and nurturing the next generation of security leaders

### Beyond the Boardroom

When I'm not architecting security strategies or connecting with data to uncover threats, I'm speaking at conferences, conducting training sessions, and mentoring folks in the NYC/NJ area who want to level up their security game. Open to opportunities, always keen to share knowledge, and genuinely excited about the future of cybersecurity.
